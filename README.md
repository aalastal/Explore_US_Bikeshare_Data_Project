# Explore_US_Bikeshare_Data_Project
Within this repository lies a Python project crafted for the Udacity Nanodegree program in Programming for Data Science using Python

# Overview
In this project, I employed Python to analyze data pertaining to bike share systems in three prominent cities within the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This involved crafting code to import the data and derive insightful insights through the calculation of descriptive statistics. Additionally, I developed a script that captures user input for an interactive terminal-based encounter, allowing for the dynamic presentation of these statistics.

# Files Used
The required files for running this program are:
1- washington.csv
2- new_york_city.csv
3- chicago.csv

# Requirements
The program was scripted using Python (version 3.10.9) and depends on the following libraries:
1- pandas==1.5.3
2- numpy==1.23.5
